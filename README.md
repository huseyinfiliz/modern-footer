### Description
This extension allows you to create a customizable, responsive footer for your Flarum forum. It automatically matches your forum’s secound color, and is fully compatible with the night mode. You can fully customize everything from the settings page. There is also an area to add your custom JS code.

If the links you add are internal links, they will open normally. If they are external links, they will open in a new tab.
